# transcluster

This is the first version of transcluster, for inferring transmission clusters from sequence alignments and sample dates.
More user-friendly interfaces are in development.

There is a simple starter vignette in the vignette folder.

The file named test2_cluster_SNP_5.csv is an example output file for the 4 sample example in the vignette.

More examples will be added soon.
