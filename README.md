# **transcluster**

### Introduction

This is **transcluster**, a package for inferring and viewing transmission clusters from sequence alignments and sample dates.

The package takes two kinds of input data

* SNP distance matrix
* Sample dates 

which can be provided directly or from fasta and csv files respectively.

There is a simple starter vignette in the vignettes folder.

A formal description of the methods is written up in [Beyond the SNP threshold: identifying outbreak clusters using inferred transmissions](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/10/319707), by 
James Stimson, Jennifer Leigh Gardy, Barun Mathema, Valeriu Crudu, Theodore Cohen, and Caroline Colijn.
